# Source code analysis and visualization of ASF projects using Apache Superset (incubating) and open source{d} tools

**Updates**:  #142

**Sent on**:  26/05/2019

**Status**:   proposed

**Author**:   Alex

**Slides**:   TBD

**Proposal**: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/source-code-analysis-and-visualization-asf-projects-using-apache-superset-incubating-and

**Abstract**:

One-sentence description of your presentation:

> Using Apache Superset (incubating) and OSS tools developed by source{d} to visualize the source code analysis results for ASF projects.

Abstract:

> ASF is a home for more than 200 projects communities and is hosting 2k git repositories with the source code. In order to get some visibility into the community over code activities, an Apache Kibble was created that gets insights into lots of metadata generated through the process of software development.
>
> In this talk, we are going to focus on the other OSS tooling needed to address the "code analysis"Â part. Git repository itself is a tremendous source of information on collaborative software development, but a barrier for getting it at scale is high: storage and processing system, parsers, visual representation, etc.
>
> We are going to share the experience of using Apache Superset (incubating) and Apache Spark for visualizing the results and scaling up the source code analysis, as well as OSS tooling developed by source{d} in order to enable better Engineering Observability.



**Notes**:

This is a prelimenary version of the talk (can be updated later), just in order to "reserve as spot" for us as it's done on such a short notice.

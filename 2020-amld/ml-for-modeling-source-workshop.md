> Machine Learning for modeling the source code

Abstract:

Machine Learning on Source Code (MLonCode) is an emerging research domain which stands at the intersection of deep learning, natural language processing, software engineering and programming language communities.

We will review recent SE tasks that benefit from applying ML and focus hands-on experience on extracting data from the real source code and developing multiple different models for a particular task of source code summarization (or function name suggestion).

Outcome

At the end of the workshop participants will build 2 working models on a real dataset, producing near state-of-the-art results. Practical skill of extracting information from source code as well as modeling different aspects of it are going to be acquired.

Prev engagements

We did a workshop in this field before, focusing more in-depth on the data exploration and pre-processing aspect of source code analysis at Singapore https://www.meetup.com/techtalkssg/events/249050395/

We are doing more introductory version of this workshop at DevFest Nantes in Oct https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/sessions/understand_your_code_with_machine_learning_on_source_code/

# Mining software development history: approaches and challenges

**Updates**:  https://github.com/src-d/conferences/issues/148

**Sent on**:  2019/07/15

**Status**:   accepted

**Author**:   Vadim

**Slides**:   http://vmarkovtsev.github.io/mlconference-2019-munich

**Proposal**: N/A

**Abstract**:

Software development history, typically represented as a Version Control System log, is a rich source of insights into how the project evolved, as well as how its developers worked. What's probably more important is that events from the past can predict the future. This talk gives fun history mining examples and presents some of the available tooling. The involved topics include graph embeddings, manifold learning, dynamic time warping, seriation, and modern clustering algorithms.

**Notes**:

Repeating the talk from [MLConference](../2019-ml-conference/MiningSDH.md). Should be very lightweight, and take only one night. They promised 500 people.
